x## Animated Game Video - Tales of Bilgewater (SOUND REMAKE) – Full Sound Design & Audio Production

This project showcases my complete sound design and audio production work for an animated game video. I was responsible for **every aspect of the audio**, from the initial concept to the final mix, crafting a cohesive and immersive sonic experience that enhances the visual storytelling.

### Scope of Work

I handled the entire audio pipeline, including:
- Designing and producing sound effects
- Recording custom Foley
- Recording and processing voices
- Creating original FX through synthesis and sound manipulation
- Selecting, editing, and layering sounds from professional libraries
- Full editing, mixing, and final audio mastering

### Sound Design & FX Creation

For each action, movement, and visual cue in the trailer, I created or selected sound elements that matched the tone and pacing of the animation. This included:
- Layering multiple samples to build complex, impactful effects  
- Designing original sounds using synthesis, modulation, and creative processing  
- Shaping audio to match the game’s atmosphere, intensity, and narrative beats  
- Using techniques such as pitch shifting, time stretching, distortion, filtering, and automation to craft unique textures

### Foley Recording

I recorded custom Foley to add realism and physicality to the animation, including:
- Footsteps on different surfaces  
- Clothing movement and character gestures  
- DIfferent room ambiences for background ambience
- Object handling, impacts, and environmental interactions  
- Subtle details that help ground the visuals in a believable space  

All Foley was cleaned, edited, and integrated into the mix to support the animation’s rhythm and emotional tone.

### Voice Recording & Processing

When required by the video:
- I recorded voice elements  
- Selected the best takes  
- Applied processing such as EQ, compression, de‑essing, reverb, and spatial effects  
- Synced the performance tightly to the animation  

### Use of Sound Libraries

While I created many sounds from scratch, I also curated and adapted sounds from professional libraries. Instead of using them “as is,” I:
- Edited and reshaped them to fit the scene  
- Combined multiple samples to create richer, more dynamic effects  
- Processed them to match the aesthetic and sonic identity of the trailer  

### Editing, Mixing & Spatial Audio

The final stage involved detailed editing and a complete mix of the project:
- Frame‑accurate alignment of all sound elements  
- Balancing levels between FX, Foley, voices, and music  
- EQ and dynamic control to maintain clarity and impact  
- Automation to emphasize key moments and transitions  
- Spatial placement and panning to create depth, movement, and immersion  

The result is a polished, cinematic audio experience that supports the trailer’s pacing, emotion, and world‑building.

This project reflects my ability to take full ownership of a sound design pipeline, combining creativity, technical skill, and attention to detail to bring animated content to life.
